### TODO to learn / to use

Technology | Description
---------- | -----------
Message broker | A message broker is an intermediary software or service that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Examples of message brokers include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ.
WebSockets | WebSockets is a protocol that enables bi-directional communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection. It provides a persistent, low-latency connection that can be used to send messages in real-time.
gRPC | gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework for building remote procedure call (RPC) APIs. It uses protocol buffers as the interface definition language and supports a variety of programming languages.
UDP | User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a transport protocol that is used to transmit data between two network hosts. Unlike Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), UDP is connectionless, which means it does not establish a reliable end-to-end connection. Instead, UDP sends data in the form of datagrams or packets, which may be lost or delivered out of order. UDP is often used for applications that require low-latency communication, such as online gaming or voice and video streaming, where some data loss is acceptable in order to achieve real-time performance.
Kubernetes | (also known as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). K8s provides a highly available and fault-tolerant platform that can run anywhere, allowing developers to easily manage their applications and services at scale. It also provides powerful features for deploying, scaling, and updating containerized applications, as well as monitoring and logging. K8s is widely used in production environments and is a popular choice for deploying cloud-native applications.
